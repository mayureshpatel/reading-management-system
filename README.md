## My Motivation
- This project was started because of my passion for reading and learning.
- The goal is to be able to quantitatively understand your reading habits by documenting the books you read.
- I began this project because I was taking a course in datbase principles and wanted to put my knowledge into practice.

## Setup
The scope of this project was initially limited to myself, so it does not have any special setup process. This project was created in Visual Studio and I have provided the important files and the solution file to get started.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
- The original scope of this project has been fulfilled and completed. I do have some features I want to add and improve upon in the future.


## Room for Improvement
Since this is one of my first major projects, I kept the overall scope to a manageable amount. However, with the current state of the project, I have several additions and improvements I want to make

Room for improvement:
- Improve the overall design of the site by adding a hero section on top and more images throughout
- Add book cover pages to the description modal
- Change the gridview templates to allow for a more aesthetic look

To do:
- Add feature to allow for a database of users that can login and use the system
- Add a feature to rate books once they have been read
- Move away from using modals to display 'more' information on books and created either dynamically created pages for each book or create a web page upon adding a book to the database
